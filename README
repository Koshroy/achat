A hobby project for setting up a an Omegle-like chat service which helps you connect with people who share similar topical intersts as you do. Matches by topical interests, location, and target gender.

The stack I am using consists of Flask a Python lightweight web framework, JQuery for a Javascript library, Prosody for an XMPP server, xmpppy for a Python xmpp implementation, sqlite3 for DB support, and Twitter bootstrap for theming/widget purposes.

Current Progress:

-- XMPP Server Setup Done
-- XMPP Client/Server Interaction Done
-- Random Webchat Done
-- Connection negotiation Done

TODO:

-- Theming
-- XMPP Random Username cleanup
-- Location matching
-- Gender matching
