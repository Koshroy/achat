A hobby project for setting up a university email-account login based speedating site. "Speedating" occurs through Omegele or Chat-Roulette style random text chatting. Identities are all anonymous and the login is only required to verify the existence of the university email account.  Contact information of upto 3 people may be saved for a period of up to 3 weeks.

The stack I am using consists of Flask a Python lightweight web framework, JQuery for a Javascript library, Prosody for an XMPP server, xmpppy for a Python xmpp implementation, sqlite3 for DB support, and Twitter bootstrap for theming/widget purposes.

Current Progress:

-- XMPP Server Setup Done
-- XMPP Client/Server Interaction Done
-- Random Webchat Done
-- Connection negotiation Done

TODO:

-- Theming
-- XMPP Random Username cleanup
-- Random Contact Info Saving
-- Messaging
